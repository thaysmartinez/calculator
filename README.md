## Usage

Supports both keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Main challenges

- Spent a few days trying to figure out how to store operands and operators
- Writing the handler functions was not a trivial task. I have now a better
  grasp of how event handling works.

## Concepts I learned and put into practice

- Array methods
- `click` and `keydown` events
- Regular expressions
- Event handlers

## What can be improved

- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-platform compatibility
