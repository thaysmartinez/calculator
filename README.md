## Usage

Supports both keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Main challenges

This was a particularly challenging project for me with the level of knowledge I
have gained so far. Wiped out all my code and started from scratch a couple of
times, but I guess this is all part of the learning process 🤷🏻‍♀️

- Spent a few days trying to figure out how to store user input in a way that
  made the calculation work both after equals is pressed or when user continues
  chaining operations by pressing the operators buttons
- Writing the handler functions was not a trivial task: I could say I have now a
  better grasp of how event handling works

## Concepts I learned and put into practice

- Array methods
- `click` and `keydown` events
- Regular expressions
- Event handlers

## What can be improved

- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-platform compatibility
